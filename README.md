# dublin-bus-routemap
This project maps all of Dublin's bus stops onto a weighted graph and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between any two stops in C.
1. t2.h is the header file and contains the struct and function signatures.
2. t2.c is the actual source code for the graph implementation of the stops and Dijkstra's alogrithm for the shortest path between two stops.
3. t2_test.c is the test code used for a more interactive interface.
4. vertices.csv and edges.csv are the files containing the stops and connections respectively.
